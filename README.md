# DriveTest
Hello Coders, I have developed a Drive Test application which is somewhat similar to Ontario's DriveTest website, where motor car drivers book their driving exam to further get valid driving license throughout the province. Here, i have developed this application using NodeJS, Express, Mongoose and MongoDB. Hope my code will surely help you in your mini-projects. Thank you
